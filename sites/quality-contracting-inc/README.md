# Rank AI — Restoration Astro Starter

**Version:** see `VERSION`
**Owner:** restorationai
**Purpose:** Canonical Astro starter for Rank AI restoration-industry client sites.

## What this is

The deterministic Astro template that Skill 3 (`rank-ai-build-site`) clones per client, theming via tokens and populating via content collections. Every Rank AI client site is a copy of this directory plus per-client content and brand config.

## What this is not

- Not a stand-alone Astro project — `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders are substituted at scaffold time and will break direct `npm install && npm run build` until Skill 3 runs.
- Not per-client customizable in the starter — per-client variation lives in three places only:
  1. Brand tokens (colors, logo, fonts, NAP) — replaced at scaffold
  2. Content collection markdown — produced by `render`
  3. Domain binding — set by `cut-over`

If you find yourself wanting to fork the starter per client, instead update this starter and version-bump. All existing client sites stay pinned to their build's starter version.

## Token reference

These `{{TOKEN}}` strings are substituted by `build_site.py scaffold` from `plan-input.json` and the client record. Adding a new token requires updating both this starter and the scaffold step.

## File layout

See `rank-ai/docs/build-site-skill-spec.md` § Outputs for the canonical tree.

## Content collections

`src/content/config.ts` defines the schemas every page entry must match. The collections map to the Astro routes:

| Collection  | Route file                                             | Frontmatter must include                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `pages`     | `src/pages/index.astro`, `src/pages/[fixed].astro`     | archetype, title, h1, meta_description, primary_keyword |
| `services`  | `src/pages/services/[slug].astro`                      | + service_slug, service_display            |
| `serviceAreas` | `src/pages/service-areas/[area].astro`             | + area_slug, city, state                   |
| `locations` | `src/pages/service-areas/[area]/[service].astro`       | + area_slug, service_slug, city, state, service_display |
| `blog`      | `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro`                          | + slug, published_at, services             |
| `legal`     | `src/pages/[legal].astro`                              | + ref (privacy/terms/accessibility)        |

## Adding a route

If a new archetype is added to the planning template, also add:
1. Content collection definition in `src/content/config.ts`
2. Route file under `src/pages/` matching the URL pattern
3. Schema-stub references in the route
4. Update this README's collection table

## Versioning

Bump `VERSION` whenever:
- A `{{TOKEN}}` is added or removed (breaking — scaffold must be updated)
- A content-collection field is added/removed/renamed (breaking — Skill 3's frontmatter writer must be updated)
- A new route or archetype is added (additive)
- A component/layout signature changes in a way Skill 3 consumes (potentially breaking)

Tweaks to copy or styling within an existing component are not breaking and don't require a bump.
